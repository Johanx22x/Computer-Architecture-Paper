# Introduction

With the rise of IoT and 4.0 industry, the increase in the number of connected devices 
around the world and the large amount of data that these devices produce becomes a big 
problem for data centralization and management, Edge Computing comes to solve this problem 
with an interesting solution.

It is introduced what Edge Computing is and how this technology solves a major 
problem of how data is manipulated in the tech industry for greater efficiency. Also, 
about the situation in Costa Rica regarding Edge Computing and how this technology is 
used in this country.

This research contributes to the understanding of Edge Computing technology, and how this 
technology is capable of solving many problems with intelligent, safe and efficient 
solutions, providing the user, company or country with an infrastructure capable of 
taking advantage of the technologies applied to their systems.
