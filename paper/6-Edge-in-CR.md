# Edge computing in Costa Rica.

Applications such as Uber, Didi, Waze or also the new technologies of electric vehicles 
with automatic driving or artificial intelligence systems, work as edge devices that are 
responsible for obtaining data to process them through technologies such as edge computing, 
and then use the information obtained. to make decisions or improve the operation of some 
systems. all these technologies are in operation in Costa Rica.

Wind River, a company that arrived in Costa Rica in 2018 that is responsible for the production 
of software for the intelligent edge, launched Wind River Studio, which is a cloud-native 
platform for the development, implementation, operations and maintaining critically important 
smart systems at the edges where safety, security and reliability are required. 
This platform enables productivity gains, improves agility and improves time to market with 
seamless technology integration including extreme edge cloud computing, data analytics and more.
Studio's cloud-native infrastructure software and analytics capabilities address the complex needs 
of service providers surrounding the deployment and management of an ultra-low latency, physically 
partitioned cloud-native infrastructure [@windriver].
