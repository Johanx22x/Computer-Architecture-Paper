# Conclusion

The Edge Computing Architecture functions efficiently regarding the analysis of information 
and regulation of the data flow, which, currently, comes as massive loads of it. However, 
because it works so closely to the source of information (it being the user and its device), 
it becomes extremely challenging to apply the correct measurements of security over the data, 
which locates the information in a vulnerable spot. Analyzing data in the edge enhances the speed, 
but decreases confidentiality.

Even though there is still some issues to resolve, it is safe to conclude that the Edge Computing 
is an amazing alternative for faster data transmission and comunication with other devices, proving 
to be even more efficient than the Cloud Computing and Fog Computing Architectures. It is specially 
effective when applied to systems in which real-time interactions and calculations are needed.

Regarding the future of this architecture, studies affirm that, in this moment, "around 10% of 
enterprise-generated data is created and processed outside a traditional centralized data center 
or cloud". By 2025, [@EdgeComputingMeaning] predicts this figure will reach an oustanding 75%. Edge 
Computing will then become essential for the process for analyzing data flow; it will make it a lighter 
and more efficient interaction.
