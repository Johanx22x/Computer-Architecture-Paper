# History

The beginnings of what is now known as Edge Computing can be traced back to the concept 
of CDN, or Content Delivery Network. This term is defined by [@bagies2022content] as “a 
network of servers hosted by a service/content provider in multiple locations of the world 
that is shared by multiple end users”. This indicates that the content provided would be 
always served from the nearest server to the user requesting for said information. The 
term was put forward by the Akamai Company in 1998, where they would establish that it 
consists on an Internet-based cache network, where the emphasis would be data backup and 
cache [@dapreliminary]. This would evolve into Edge Computing later by emphasizing on 
function cache instead, which is data processing.

Following the CDN, in August 2006, a new business model was brought to the public’s 
attention by the CEO of Google Eric Schmidt. He exposed what the concept of “Cloud 
Computing” meant; a collection of networks in which the users could utilize its modalities 
from any device, via the Internet. The primordial services provided by this technology 
are Software, Platform and Infrastructure, all of them as different services that, just 
as water or electricity, could be provided or distributed around the world 
[@srivastava2018review]. 

The rising of Cloud Computing meant that there would be a centralization of data inside 
the cloud of each enterprise that worked with loads of information. Nevertheless, the 
amount of users that transmitted information grew exponentially, therefore demanding a 
solution for the analysis of that much information. Cisco, in 2011, then proposed a new 
term that would seek out to solvent this problem: Fog Computing. The concept is defined 
by [@atlam2018fog] as follows:

> “Fog Computing is a geographically distributed computing architecture with a resource 
pool which consists of one or more ubiquitously connected heterogeneous devices (including 
edge devices) at the edge of network and not exclusively seamlessly backed by Cloud 
services, to collaboratively provide elastic computation, storage and communication (and 
many other new services and tasks) in isolated environments to a large scale of clients 
in proximity.”

Because the devices were heterogeneous, the technology functioned as an intermediary between 
the cloud and all the processing, storage, and networking services the end device would 
require. This meant that the fog nodes (the previously mentioned heterogeneous devices) 
could be deployed anywhere with a network connection, relieving the enormous data flow 
that a certain company could receive [@atlam2018fog]. Hence the name, Fog Computing; fog 
is closer to the individual that the cloud.

After culminating with the expansion of Fog Computing, a need to consolidate the connection 
between the information provided and its analysis rose. This was where Edge Computing saw a 
golden period of development (2015 to 2017). The composed system that resulted after uniting 
all previously mentioned technologies left a great form of treating data as close to the 
user as possible. This meant faster data analysis, lower latency, and better interactions 
between devices [@dapreliminary].
